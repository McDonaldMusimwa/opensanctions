  Clinical researchers who have been prohibited from participating in FDA-regulated clinical investigations.
description: |
  The FDA regulates clinical investigators who conduct studies intended to provide evidence on the safety
  and effectiveness of investigational medical products. Clinical investigators must follow applicable
  statutes and regulations to ensure the integrity of clinical data and, for studies involving human subjects,
  to protect their rights, safety, and welfare. If the FDA determines that a clinical investigator has violated
  these requirements—such as through data falsification or noncompliance—it may initiate a disqualification
  proceeding. A disqualified (or “totally restricted”) clinical investigator is not eligible to receive
  investigational products or conduct certain clinical investigations until reinstated, if that option is granted.
