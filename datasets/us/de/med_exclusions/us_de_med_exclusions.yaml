  This dataset provides details on health care providers who have been sanctioned
  by Medicaid or the Office of Inspector General (OIG). It includes records of
  both individual providers and entities, outlining their sanctions, descriptions
  of violations, and associated regulatory actions. 

  These sanctions result from findings of fraud, abuse, or violations of Medicaid
  policies. The dataset covers a range of sanctions, from temporary suspensions
  to permanent terminations, and includes details on providers' reinstatement
  statuses when applicable.
