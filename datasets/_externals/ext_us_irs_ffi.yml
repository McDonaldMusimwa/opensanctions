    The IRS is a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. In the United States, the Congress passes 
    tax laws and requires taxpayers to comply. The taxpayerâ€™s role is to understand and meet his or 
    her tax obligations. The IRS role is to help the large majority of compliant taxpayers with the 
    tax law, while ensuring that the minority who are unwilling to comply pay their fair share.
